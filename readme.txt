== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Who should use Crew HRM? =
Anyone who needs to share jobs on their website and accept applications from their website. This would give a professional impression and help you save time compared to using forms and emails.
= What are the server requirements? =
You can use our plugin on any WordPress site. We used React.js to make it, so it works well in your browser. If you have a lot of employees (over 3000) and many using it at once (over 200), a dedicated hosting package works better than shared hosting.
