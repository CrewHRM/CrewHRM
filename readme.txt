===The pro version of the plugin includes additional features, such as:===

* **Google Meet integration:** Schedule and conduct Google Meet interviews directly from within the plugin.
* **Appointments:** Schedule and manage appointments with candidates.
* **Zoom integration:** Schedule and conduct Zoom interviews directly from within the plugin.
* **Custom Fields:** Add different fields to ask questions that would help you screen the candidates better.
* **Email Communications:** Communicate with the applicants from the review screen and get notifications about different events in the system.
* **Custom Attachment Support:** Allow different file formats to be uploaded when designers and creative professionals apply to your job post.
* **Employee Portal:** The employee portal launches on the website's front end without any header or footer. It would give an app-like user experience. You can use this feature like SaaS applications. The employees can manage their leave requests, update information, add their bank account and payment information, and everything else necessary.
* **Leave Management:** This feature is divided into several parts. You can create global leave policies in the settings, apply the leave policies applicable to each employee, and override them to make exceptions. Employees can request leaves from their frontend profile after logging in. The system keeps a clear account of the pending, used, and unused leaves and displays them in the profile. The HR Manager can review leave requests from the employee list in the WordPress Admin Dashboard. S/he can accept or reject the requests from there.

This WordPress HRM plugin is the perfect solution for any business that wants to streamline its hiring process and attract the best talent.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Who should use Crew HRM? =
Anyone who needs to share jobs on their website and accept applications from their website. This would give a professional impression and help you save time compared to using forms and emails.
= What are the server requirements? =
You can use our plugin on any WordPress site. We used React.js to make it, so it works well in your browser. If you have a lot of employees (over 3000) and many using it at once (over 200), a dedicated hosting package works better than shared hosting.
= Do you offer a whitelabeling feature? =
Yes, we offer a whitelable setting on the Pro add-on to change the name and images easily. If you prefer to use the free version only, you can change the name using translation plugins like Loco Translate or the Say What plugin.
= Can I go ahead and customize the plugin? =
Yes, as Crew HRM is offered under the GPL license, you can modify it any way you like. There is no restriction at all. So that you know, we do not offer support for customized plugins.
= Can you develop a custom feature for me? =
Unfortunately, we are unable to offer customizations right now. You can hire a developer from a marketplace, and we'll gladly help your developer.
= Is this plugin multisite compatible? =
No. We are not supporting multisite installations at this moment.
